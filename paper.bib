    abstract={Answering a question of Vera S{\'o}s, we show how Lov{\'a}sz' lattice reduction can be used to find a point of a given lattice, nearest within a factor ofcd(c = const.) to a given point in Rd. We prove that each of two straightforward fast heuristic procedures achieves this goal when applied to a lattice given by a Lov{\'a}sz-reduced basis. The verification of one of them requires proving a geometric feature of Lov{\'a}sz-reduced bases: ac1dlower bound on the angle between any member of the basis and the hyperplane generated by the other members, wherec1 = {\textsurd}2/3.},
